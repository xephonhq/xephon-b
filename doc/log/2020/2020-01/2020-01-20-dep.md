# 2020-01-20 dep

Spent some time to clean up the code, it took longer than expected

- restructured libtsdb-go a bit, move interface around and copy paste stuff, rename package imports etc.

The test for influxdb is working again! At least for the counter reporter

```text
cd script/influxdb
./novolume.sh
./createdb.sh

cp xb.example.yml xb.yml
xb run
```
