# 2020-01-20 embed

Inspired by https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/tree/master/query/promql/internal/promqltests
We can test and compare tsdb storage engine performance without going through wire protocol.
This should be trivial for tsdb written in go. 
This would also allow us to inspect the outdisk format of different tsdb easier.
The trick is to use go mod for each database to avoid dragging (potentially conflict) dependencies.
It also allow us to dive into other tsdb's code easier.

TODO

- change influxdb to use storage engine directly, i.e. no new servers
- write the actual test logic and import from pkg
- rename packages and update README
  - embed -> engine
  - pkg -> e2e
